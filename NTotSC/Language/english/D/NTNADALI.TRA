@0    = ~It's nice to meet you. I'm Nadalin.~
@1    = ~Hi. I'm Nadalin. I come from up north, from the place where the Sword Coast transmutes into a gulf. Unfortunately, my village was terrorized by some fire monsters and my boat is now the home of some sirens. I escaped from the village and now I live here. But I'd like to return to my duties.~
@2    = ~Remove Fire Salamanders

In Baldur's Gate we met a friendly fisherman, Nadalin. It looks as thougth very strange things are happening in the north in the place he lived.  He claims that fire salamanders have attacked his village and now no one can fish in the area.  I must take a good look at the problem if I get up there.~
@3    = ~You don't have the heart, do you?  It's alright, I know where you're coming from. I couldn't do it, myself.~
@4    = ~You've done it, right? I guess, that your hearts are even harder than I'd wish to have. I don't say it with pleasure, but if you are ever in need of help, you'll probably find me near my boat in my village.~
@5    = ~Remove Fire Salamanders

We have found Nadalin, who's a fisherman and a sailor. He can now return to his homeland.~
@6    = ~Thanks for your help. Now I can return to my village. If you ever need me you may find me near my boat. I love my old lady.~
@7    = ~I'm no fighter, friend.~
@8    = ~Welcome my friends. How can I help you?~
@9    = ~I want you to take us to an island inhabited by some ice salamanders. Have you ever heard about it?~
@10   = ~We were just passing by to see how you are getting on.~
@11   = ~I think, I have, but it's a dangerous place. The lizards attack without warning. I landed once on that island during a storm. I hardly managed to run away. Do you want to travel there now?~
@12   = ~Yes, I think we can set off.~
@13   = ~No, not now. But it's nice to hear that you want to help us.~
@14   = ~Are you fed up with this island already?~
@15   = ~Yes, let's get out of here.~
@16   = ~No, wait for a little longer.~
