@0    = ~Who comes to Meadar? Monoach haven't sent you, but you know that it is me to look for? ...Why?~
@1    = ~Welcome. We haven't expected a warm welcome, but despite that, you want to talk to us.~
@2    = ~Meandar knows that someone who is coming seeks an answer... Is Meandar wrong?~
@3    = ~We don't have time for "guess who...". We assume that you have a key. It is even more probable since you have known Monoach. We need it.~
@4    = ~Meandar is right. Can you give us the key, which you posses - as I assume?~
@5    = ~Meandar will give you the key, but you'll have to work for it. Nothing's for free. Meandar has an enemy. Ice Salamanders used to be a family, but now they are no more. Kolchear is not a real Salamander and he left the house with his companions.~
@6    = ~So - something regular... Where can we find this Kolchear?~
@7    = ~What? Not again. Is there a way to avoid these forever lasting confilcts?~
@8    = ~Kolchear has already found you, since the beings from the first sphere irritate him, since he's alive... You may expect to meet him, as soon as you leave our house. Kolchear is dangerous, so good luck, and watch out for yourself. Come back here later and you'll receive the key, if you're still alive...~
@9    = ~Why doesn't Meandar beat his enemies on his own instead of using the travelers?~
@10   = ~Ice Salamanders might not like one another, but they don't fight... They do not posses a weapon, which could threaten another Salamander...~
@11   = ~Meandar is not happy that his brothers are gone, but he respects the valour and courage of the newcomers. Here's your key. Look closely at the way it is mastered cause a great evil is hidden behind it... ancient and cruel...~
@12   = ~What evil? What do you know about it?~
@13   = ~Meandar and Monoach were friends... a long time ago. But Monoach would have never told us the usage of the key nor the way its paths lead... But Monoach wouldn't have given us the key if he was not afraid of its destiny. Meandar knows nothing more.~
@14   = ~Meandar knows nothing more.~
@15   = ~Welcome. Who are you that you find our House?~
@16   = ~I come from afar and I need your help... or rather a key...~
@17   = ~Do you know the story of Monoach?... That's good. But you don't know that Monoach was fighting against some cult. He abhors the Black Hand - the creation of Bhaal and as long as their new temple exists, there is no way I can help you. Come back, when their leader is dead. I'll know if it is done.~
