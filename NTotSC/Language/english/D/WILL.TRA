@5    = ~We have many Inns for the frugal adventurer. The Red Sheaf has basic rooms, though the clientele is a touch rowdy. There is also the Burning Wizard and the Jovial Juggler, which also have finer suites. The Red Sheaf is near the center of town, as is the Burning Wizard. The Jovial Juggler is a bit further along, and sits on the southern edge of the city. ~
@6    = ~Thanks for your help.~

Feldepost's Inn is in the west, closer to the south edge of town.~
@10   = ~A drop or two to ease your spirits? The Burning Wizard and the Red Sheaf are in the center of town. Feldepost's Inn is along the western edge, and The Jovial Juggler is along the south. They will all serve you well.~

@17   = ~Are you talking about this flail?~
@18   = ~Certainly, about it and myself...~
@19   = ~Don't all peasants use a flail in the fields? Isn't it created for that?~
@20   = ~Forgive me, your way is out of mine yet, maybe we'll meet again...~
@21   = ~I hope that you're really good with it, come on.~
@22   = ~Are you laughing at it? Maybe I shouldn't start it...~
@23   = ~That's too bad, farewell then.~

@25   = ~Is there anything else?~
@26   = ~There is an unusual young man living in Beregost - Will Scarlet, though some call him Will Tell Helm. I decided to take him with me, his extraordinary abilities and verve can appear helpfull one day...~

@30   = ~Welcome again, how can I help you?~
@31   = ~Nothing indeed, farewell!~
@32   = ~Is your offer still up-to-date? I will gladly see you in action...~
@33   = ~Uhm... how should I tell you... At Feldepost's I pledged my favourite flail, you know, I needed money for a living... If we get some gold, I could take it back...~
@34   = ~How much then?~
@35   = ~At least 1000 gp... Eekhm... I also commissioned an armor at Taerom's smithy... For 5000 gp... I don't even know how I would be able to pay for it... However he told me the job would take much time to finish due to my orders...~
@36   = ~There will be plenty of time to think about it. Let's move.~
@37   = ~Will pledged his original flail at Feldepost's for a thousand gp. I should consider taking it back. He also ordered a new armor at smithery of Taerom Thunderhammer in Beregost. If  we have the money it will be available for ... 5000 gp...! My new friend is "precious" indeed!~
