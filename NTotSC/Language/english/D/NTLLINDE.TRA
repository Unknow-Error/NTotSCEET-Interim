@0    = ~Hello.~
@1    = ~I've lost my lucky arrow around here somewhere and can't seem to find it.~
@2    = ~Here I am, yet another lowly adventurer beating about the bushes, looking for some stranger's lucky arrow. I mean, Llindellyn is a nice enough guy but... shouldn't I be out slaying tarrasques or something?? ~
@3    = ~Any luck finding that arrow of mine?~
@4    = ~It's silly, I know, but it just doesn't feel right without my lucky arrow. Here, let me give you a little something in exchange. They're great for anything with tough skin.~
@5    = ~My lucky arrow! Others may fly straighter or do more damage but without my lucky arrow on me, I might as well wield a club. Here, let me give you some arrows of detonation. No pun intended but they really are a blast!~
@6    = ~Oh, now this is going to be fun.~
@7    = ~How were those arrows I gave you?~
@8    = ~Perhaps your archer could help me.~
