@0    = ~So someone has finally found the place of my torment. Welcome, whoever you are. Unfortunately I cannot see you, but the sounds of my companions in our suffering can be heard in the entire cell... Never mind. I don't think they will suffer any longer...~
@1    = ~I am <CHARNAME> and your... as you call it... place is on tongues of the whole town of Beregost. Why are you haunting here?~
@2    = ~What are you doing... What are you all doing?~
@3    = ~I am one. But I am... Yeees three... Touch, hearing and smell. There are three of us. That is my punishment. Punishment for the death... punishment... But I wanted nothing more than to destroy the evil... But the evil is stronger... And now I am one of the evil... one of them...~
@4    = ~Can you be more specific?~
@5    = ~And as I understand, you'd like us to help you?~
@6    = ~I am undead... a phantom... powerful but unfortunatelly unwilling to cause damage on the surface... I don't know if it's my wisdom that saved my mind or it is just another part of my punishment... revenge.~
@7    = ~Is there a way to ease your suffering?~
@8    = ~A way... Help... Is always. You were not terrified to enter this cave... you didn't run away in madness... My torturers have not foreseen this... There is a sword... A sword to the collection of vampire ideas for a revenge... Vampiric sword... If you could possess it and bring it here as well as some holy water... I will walk away... Walk away... At last...~
@9    = ~I'll help you. Just stop haunting...~
@10   = ~Just like that? Where can I find this sword? And do you have anything in exchange for me?~
@11   = ~Eeeee, I don't even think about running after your bussiness. Maybe I should just kill you?~
@12   = ~I don't know... I don't even try to guess... But it exists... I've even wielded it... When was that...? And you'll find some useful items in my chamber...~
@13   = ~We'll see what we can do...~
@14   = ~That'll be very challenging, but it's some kind of a rescue after all... You wanna try?~
@15   = ~Why not... Prepare yourself!~
@16   = ~Aaa...Eeee... Maybe next time?~
@17   = ~Whatever you want... Help me or kill me...~
@18   = ~A phantom, or phantoms, reside in the cave, east of the Song of the Morning Temple... This "something" tells stories about the vampire's revenge... It needs the Vampiric Sword and holy water or some true tough guys to "send" them to the beyond... We'll see what can be done...~
@19   = ~You are back? But I can't feel the power of the items... They are required...~
@20   = ~Or you come here to kill me...? Do you?~
@21   = ~No, I'm here for just a while... Farewell!~
@22   = ~Oh yes. It's time to challenge you, phantom in three persons...~
@23   = ~I can feel that you have what I asked for... Torquion will be free at last... Wait a minute...~
@24   = ~The phantom from the cave of Beregost received all the required items and finally it went away... they went away... It's time to peek into its chamber!!!~
@25   = ~You have the sword... But I can't leave without the holy water...~
@26   = ~Holy water!... But you don't have the sword... My sword is very necessary...~
