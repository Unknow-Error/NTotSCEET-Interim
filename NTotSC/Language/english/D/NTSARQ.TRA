@0    = ~Hello! And who we've got here?.... Sorry, you are not the person...
Tell then, what brings you here?~
@1    = ~It looks like someone forgot something. We were hired to take it for him. But he never said a word about a Red Mage in the residence. Fulfill our curiosity - who might you be?~
@2    = ~I have no idea what you are talking about. I came here for a reason, but probably missed the place. Good bye!~
@3    = ~Ha, ha, the old scamp ran away so fast he forgot the shoes? That's good! It must have been something really valuable since he had to ask anyone to bring it instead of himself... Doesn't matter... I only care about that poor mage. He shouldn't have escaped! The Red Mages do not forget so easy... Enough talking! I feel like spilling my anger. And you look very relevant! Ha-ha-ha. When we finish, your skulls tell me all I need. Ha-ha-ha!~
@4    = ~Not so fast, friend! You go nowhere, I think. There are no clues of my existence, wherever I appear! Ha-ha-ha.~
