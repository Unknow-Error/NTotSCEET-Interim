@0    = ~Take your piety elsewhere, fools. It has no place here.~
@1    = ~An old "friend" of mine took too close of a liking to some boots of mine. Her name's Pilar and she's probably hiding out at the Friendly Arm Inn, if I know her right. I don't care how you have to do it but I must have those boots back. ~
@2    = ~I stumbled across a dirty little gnome called Gheldehar in an alleyway, today. He claims that Pilar, an old 'friend' currently staying at the Friendly Arm Inn, has stolen his boots and he would like to have them returned. As Gheldehar didn't seem to care how I might acquire them, I suspect his use of the term 'friend' was little more than window-dressing.~
@3    = ~I see you don't have my boots with you. Do not test my patience as I do not take well to enemies.~
@4    = ~My boots... Just let me put these on for a moment...~
@5    = ~Your service has been exemplary. Here is 90 gp for a rainy day...~
@6    = ~Ah, my boots. You have done well. In payment, allow me heal some of your wounds.~
@7    = ~Your ongoing visits are less than discreet. I urge you to discontinue them at once.~
@8    = ~Feeling brave, are we?~
