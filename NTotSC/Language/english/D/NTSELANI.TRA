@0    = ~Great Mother! You have frigtened me indeed! DO YOU ALWAYS ACT LIKE GOING ANYWHERE WITHOUT KNOCKING ON A DOOR? AND WHAT ABOUT IF I AM JUST GETTING DRESSED?~
@1    = ~You again! To tell the truth, I have noticed there is something wrong with you, but I am packing up my things right now and disappear, so "easy come, easy go" like they say... ~
@2    = ~Welcome again and gooood-bye for ever! Bye - bye!~
@3    = ~You're obviously here on important business friends.  If you want to see Davaeorn, he's on the fourth floor.~
@4    = ~All rigth now... just kidding... Since I have been told to move here, I can meet only those man-at-arms of Daevorn, so you make a little change anyway...
For sure you are brought here 'cause he shakes with fear of some group... I'm sure - whoever they are - they are smart enough to keep far away from the woods like this. Ya know, druids, spiders, savages, the only thing we miss here are the bearded women and flying rabbits...
If you have something to exchange, then let's do it, for I never finish putting these things in order...~
