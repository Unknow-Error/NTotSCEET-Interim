@0    = ~If you don't mind, I have another quest to offer to you. Near the Firewine Bridge we discovered an entrance to the remaining dungeon part of the city ruins. Unfortunately, there are evil spirits inside, but it shouldn't be too much trouble for you. I want you to go there and clean it out - that would give me the opportunity to begin a new exploration.~
@1    = ~Unfortunately, I have other quests to solve right now.  You will need to find someone else.~
@2    = ~Sure, we can take them on, no matter what the 'spirits' are.~
@3    = ~As you wish. I cannot order you go there, particularly after such a day as this.  Good bye!~
@4    = ~Thank you. I have the scroll containing the seal that will allow you to get inside. The entrance is protected by a ward, made by my friend, a mage, to keep out any accidental passers by. You know what I mean, now.  So take this scroll, you will be able to pass through the entrance unimpeded.~
@5    = ~Charleston Nib, who we saved after his diggers went insane in the Kozah's crypt, offered us an additional quest.  There is a warded entrance on the Firewine Bridge leading into a new dungeon.  However, "evil spirits" are dwelling inside and he is unable to explore them. He has asked us to clear them out for him.~
