@0    = ~Fools! Without my sword I couldn't leave the crypt anyhow... Trapped and taken down...
But you - ignorants - you make me free now... The time to gather my forces and repay vengeance comes finally to everyone who dares to call my name! ATTACK, MY MONSTERS!~
@1    = ~Quite unrewarding, we finally got into the crypt of orcs' respected leader... He took his sword and he and his cour attacked us... Dramatic experience...~
@2    = ~Welcome, the cursed ones! Have you come to set me free from this ugly crypt? The company of skeletons and spiders can make oneself bored indeed... for so many years... But... Where is my sword?... cannot sense it...
This way... You will DIE!~
@3    = ~When we finally got into the crypt that was so respected by the orcs, we were stopped by Ghotal himself and his court... Dramatic experience...~
