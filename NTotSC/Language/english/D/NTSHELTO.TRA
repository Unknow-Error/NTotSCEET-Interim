@0    = ~'Ere there.  Not all the guard resent your coming as Eldod does.  ~
@1    = ~It's dangerous to go against your Captain so.~
@2    = ~Good to know, though I doubt I shall be much help with him around.~
@3    = ~I trust none of the guard while he commands you.  Leave me be.~
@4    = ~Eldod is NOT my Captain.  MY Captain is a noble man who never would have let this go so long without requesting aid.  Eldod has but made the problem worse.  I will deny I said this if you tell another soul.  I must go.~
@5    = ~I blame you not at all.  It is as though he be TRYING to isolate us.  I wonder if it's possible the disappearances have weakened his sanity.  Alas, it is not for me to say.  I have said too much already.  I must go.~
@6    = ~Doubtful ANY of us will be of help while he commands.  I can speak with you no longer, lest he see us together.  Fare thee well.~
@7    = ~I cannot be seen speaking with such as you.  Go away!~
@8    = ~If I were you, I would be careful of Eldod.  He is not a man to be trusted; take it from me friend.~
@9    = ~I'll not speak a word after what you did!~
