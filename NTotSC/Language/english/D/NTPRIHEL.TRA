@1    = ~Sorry, the thought of being watched by some kind of ceaseless eye disturbs me immensely. I'll find my own way out.~
@2    = ~I'd like to see what services you have to provide.~
@3    = ~Why is your altar locked? That's very interesting...~
@4    = ~Don't even dare to touch it! If you're so interested in this, you should go and talk to Avery. He takes care of this altar. But I doubt he'll be willing to talk about it considering the current situation...~
@5    = ~There is a locked altar in the citadel. That's interesting... It's said that Avery knows something about it. We must ask him about it if we get a chance...~
