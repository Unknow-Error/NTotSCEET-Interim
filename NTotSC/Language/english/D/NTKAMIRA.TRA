@0    = ~I have little patience for these paltry pleasantries, but we should know whom we are to fight beside.  I am Kamira, and a more competent blade you will not find this side of Waterdeep.  I have been paid well to be here, but the sooner we are done, the better.  It is likely but a wild dog or some such that plagues these foolish monks.   I prefer more challenging circumstances.  Life is made fun by crushing your enemies.~
@1    = ~It is a good time for us to go our separate ways.  Perhaps we shall meet again.~
@2    = ~Kobalds?  So few would never come this close to a fortified keep.  They've not the stomach for overwhelming odds.  Strange...~
@3    = ~That was an ogre! They were talking about a mausoleum! We'll meet there!~
@4    = ~Flattery will get you nowhere.  ~
