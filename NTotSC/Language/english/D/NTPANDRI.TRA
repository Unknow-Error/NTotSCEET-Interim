@0    = ~Whoever you are - you came right in time... for sure we would end up impaled... by these... these beasts... I believe my wife - Yness - sent you...?~
@1    = ~No way, man, and your life is worthless so much, we will end now all your troubles, and should we rape your wife for fun... The show must go on, you now...~
@2    = ~Yes, she did, your wife is in Ulgoth's Beard and she pointed us to where we could find you. So, it looks you are free now.~
@3    = ~Your jokes are crazy, but maybe you are right and the world got crazy...~
@4    = ~Oh! Thank you for saving me! I don't have anything to offer but maybe this would do. I've heard orcs talking here and there. I think that they have come here because a great orcs' leader is burried somewhere near here. They look for some artifacts lost within ages, but with no success up till now. Shamans have been making sacrifices for Gruumsh to evoke his signs. They are also trying to enter an old chapel in a forest, east from here, but unsuccessfully as well...~
@5    = ~They search for some cultists which they are conflicted with. I've heard a name, something like Haanibal... but I can be wrong... and I'll write you a letter. Please give it to my wife. Now, I should go home... but until someone solves the mystery of the orcs the farms cannot be safe. They are not safe even without the orcs. Thank you once again! Good luck!~
