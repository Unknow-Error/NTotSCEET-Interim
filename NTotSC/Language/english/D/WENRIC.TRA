@0    = ~Having an opportunity for you brave scouts, I can advise you to avoid The Fields of the Dead. It has been regularly dwelled by orcs and other lost souls for ages, but they are unexpecantly great numbers recently. We are able to feel their presence for they are trying to kidnapp somebody again and again... My neighbor, Yness, moved to Ulgoth's Beard for help, since her husband had disappeared. She must have been there for a week, now. Maybe even she never got there... Well, don't know what are your plans, but be careful.~
@1    = ~Farmer from north of the Gate told us about unusual activity of the orcs in the area. orcs are kidnapping villagers, like we heard inside Baldur's Gate, and they seem to be very dangerous. It should be checked out in the near future.~
